**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic covered in my domain is colormetrics. Essentially colormetrics uses the color of perovskite film as a proxy for how degraded it is. The degradation can be monitored by using tools such as very accurate microscopes and other sensors but using colormetrics is a better method as it is quicker and does not interrupt the exposure of the films.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

An investigation that would be worth pursuing would be to see what models work best for predicting how long until a film is fully degraded and what variables correlate with a higher lifetime.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

A potential change I would have made would be to investigate the graph database more deeply to gain a better understanding of the different attributes of each node in preparation for building ML models.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

One technique I would be interested in using would be Graph Machine Learning. Currently, the technique we are using is to extract data from nodes from the graph database and turn all that data tabular in order for us to use conventional ML models and neural nets. By using graph ML we would be getting rid of the middle step of converting graph db data into a tabular format.
